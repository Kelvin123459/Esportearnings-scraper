# Esportsearning.com website scraper
#### Author: Kelvin García Muñiz
***
This notebook was created to scrape data from the website [esportsearnings.com](https://www.esportsearnings.com/) to perform a data analysis study. This was done using primarily the [Selenium library](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) with the assistance of [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=find_all#). 

The scraper produces .csv files, each corresponding to the following data:
>1. Video Games Data
>2. Players Data
>3. Esports Teams Data
>4. Participant Countries Data

To view the analysis head over to the corresponding [Github Repository](https://github.com/Kelvin123459/Esports-Analysis).
